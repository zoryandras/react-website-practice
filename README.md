Hello everyone and welcome to my React practice webpage!

For this webpage I use React, Styled Components, React Router, FaIcon and useState. :)

It's just a demo webpage which I can send beside my CV and such. Mind you, I only study React for like one month, so I know it will be better, because I really try to deepen my knowledge about this amazing language!

You can view the webpage [here](https://zoryandras.github.io/react-website-practice/)!

I hope you like it!
